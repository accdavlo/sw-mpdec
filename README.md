# Modified Patankar Deferred Correction Application for Shallow Water equations

This is the public repository refering to the article [arXiv prepint to be put](https://arxiv.org) where we include the Fortran code which we used to develop the method.

This code is based on a finite volume WENO5 space discretization that is available at [FV-solver-SW](https://github.com/jbnunezd/fv-solver-sw.git) developed by Jonatan Núñez-de la Rosa.
